# flutter_splash_screen_22october_v3

Test project, checking the functionality and capabilities of widgets using Flutter. <br>
This application has the following functionality:

Shows a full-screen splash screen for 3 seconds. <br>
Shows a screen to select login or register. <br>
If you choose login, it shows a screen with input fields "login", "password", a "remember" checkmark and a "next" button. <br>
If login = "admin" and password = "123456" then the following screen with the text "Congratulations!" will be displayed. <br>
If the login and password are incorrect, a message about this will be shown to the user. <br>
If the login was correct and the "remember" checkmark was checked, the next time after the splash, the "Congratulations!" screen immediately opens. <br>
